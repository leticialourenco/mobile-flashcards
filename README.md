# React Native - Mobile Flashcards

This is the final project for the React Native module of Udacity's React Nanodegree. This mobile application let users create collections of question cards, add cards containing questions and answers to these collections, and interact with the content created by practicing their answering skills using the cards to display the combined answer. A score containing the percentage of right answers is displayed at the end of each practice session and daily notifications are sent when the user hasn't completed a session for that day.

## Get up and running

* install dependencies and start the project

```bash
> npm install
> npm start
```
* use the options displayed by the packager to access the app via iOS device or Emulator (both using [Expo](https://expo.io))
